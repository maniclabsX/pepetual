# Overflow Naming Framework

PEPETUAL Millionaire leans into an Overflow theme so every public touchpoint feels consistent. Use the vocabulary below across UI copy, socials, and community updates.

## Core Vocabulary

| Concept | Preferred Term | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pool of accrued PEPE | **Pond** | The place trading fees accumulate until they spill over. |
| Target amount | **Overflow Point** | The PEPE threshold that triggers a spillover. |
| Draw event | **Spillover** | Snapshot + Chainlink VRF selection when the Overflow Point is met. |
| Reward payout | **Catch** | The PEPE sent to the selected Frogholder. |
| Eligible holder | **Frogholder** | Any wallet holding ≥ 100 PEPETUAL prior to a snapshot. |

## Standard Messaging Flow

1. **Pond Fills** – Trading fees route into the active Pond as PEPE.
2. **Overflow Point** – Once the Pond hits its Overflow Point, a spillover is scheduled.
3. **Spillover Event** – The protocol snapshots Frogholders and Chainlink VRF selects one.
4. **Catch** – The chosen Frogholder catches the PEPE spillover automatically.

## Copy Examples

- **Status Card** — “Tadpole Pond is 72 % full. Spillover triggers at $10K PEPE.”
- **Event Toast** — “Spillover complete — wallet 0x123… caught 420,690 PEPE.”
- **Eligibility Reminder** — “Hold 100+ PEPETUAL to remain a Frogholder and eligible for spillovers.”

## Consistency Notes

- Avoid casino terms like “jackpot” or “win.” Stick to Pond/Overflow/Spillover/Catch.
- Memes can lean into frog language: “pond spilling,” “Frogholders catching,” “spillovers flowing.”
- Keep serious docs professional: “When the Overflow Point is met, a spillover distributes a catch.”

Use this as the single source of truth when crafting marketing, UI copy, or partner announcements.
